Description: The package offers simple and easy to use functions 
    that perform k-means clustering. In particular, the different 
    stages of clustering are broken up into separate 
    functions (initialization, clustering, and plotting). 
    This allows the user to investigate exactly what is going 
    on at each step, which promotes an understanding of this 
    disparate aspects of the clustering procedure. 
    Furthermore, the plotting (perhaps the most rewarding part 
    of the process) can be done easily - assuming we are in two 
    dimensions - and results in visually appealing images (thanks to ggplot2). 
    An example of how this organizational pattern could prove 
    useful is as an aid to understanding kmeans clustering. 
    Other packages in the R ecosystem that are related/overlap 
    with this package are: kmeans and KMeans_rcpp.
